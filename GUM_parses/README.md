## Notes

An `.rs3` and `.rsd` automatic parses from the experiments in Section 3.3 are provided for the GUM document `GUM_whow_joke` in the `sample` folder for reference (this is the document from which the example OOD parser output is extracted, as shown in Appendix G). All GUM parses from all experiments are provided [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wi9RZOoIaXF4If6sNfWS40fN_xO1y1_B?usp=share_link) with corresponding section number and experiment names to facilitate future research and detailed error analyses.
